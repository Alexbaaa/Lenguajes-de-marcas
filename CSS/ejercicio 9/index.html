        <p>Tim Ryan was the smartest kid in the room—in his
        classroom, that is—in 8th grade back in 1952. And that 
        was no small feat because that classroom was full of 
        girls who studied hard all the time. The boys were less 
        diligent and didn’t normally score as high as the girls 
        on tests. But Tim Ryan usually scored 100% on tests. He
        had already won an academic scholarship to one of the 
        finest private high schools in Chicago. His only flaw 
        was poor handwriting.Tim Ryan was the smartest kid in the room—in his

        <p>Mud Boy splashed through the puddles and sloshed 
        through the mud, then launched himself onto the soggy 
        turf. The field was so rutted from dog play that he 
        didn’t slide but stuck in place—his face submerged in 
        two inches of water, his loins in cold mud. Mud Boy’s
        mother laughed nervously, for people were watching. 
        Mud Boy smiled up with a wet clump of grass sticking 
        out of his mouth. His mom smiled down at him. “You 
        look like those dinos eating in our book.” Mud Boy splashed through the puddles and sloshed
